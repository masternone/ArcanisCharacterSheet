The Arcanis Character Sheet is a Node.js project.
The goal for using Node.js to allow for easier set up, but setting up a persistant store that does not require the storing of data in the code repositortity so I can take advantage of free hosting is not that simple.

To install Node.js follow the instrunction on http://nodejs.org/

To install the dependencies:

npm install

The presistant store I have chosen is Redis.

To install Redis follow the instrunctions on http://redis.io/topics/quickstart

to start the server

$ node ./app

to view the results

http://localhost:3000
